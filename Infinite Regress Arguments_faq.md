# [Infinite Regress Arguments](https://www.plato.stanford.edu/entries/infinite-regress/index.html) 

## According to the defender of the a - series , how does reality change? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The way things were and the way things will be seems to be part of reality in a way that, for example, Bilbo’s finding the One Ring is not. How can they both contribute to the way reality is if they are incompatible? **The defender of the A-series replies that in giving the complete account of how reality is we have to take seriously the fact that reality changes and that it is, therefore, different ways successively, and there is no inconsistency in things being one way and then another.**

## What type of commitments lead to a regress that is objectionable to both theorists and one other? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : In the previous section we saw two theories generating similar regresses, but where one is found unobjectionable whereas the other is found objectionable due to the different things we think we know. **We could also have cases where a single theory yields a regress that is objectionable by the lights of one theorist and not another, as a result of their differing theoretical commitments leading one but not the other to think that a feature revealed by the regress is a vice.** In the next section we will look at the different arguments that can be made for and against different theories.

## How much deferred would a dependent entity be in the case of an infinite regress of ontological dependence? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Schaffer claims that in the case of an infinite regress of ontological dependence, with each entity depending on the next in the chain, and no independent entities, being would be ‘infinitely deferred, never achieved’ The idea seems to be that a dependent entity only has the being it has on condition of something else having being.** If this process never stops, the promissory note is never paid, in which case, allegedly, the existence of all these things could never get off the ground in the first place.

## What type of person is to hold that each belief is justified in virtue of the next one being justified? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Epistemic Infinitists embrace the infinite regress of reasons and argue that it is not vicious. **One response for the Infinitist to make to the regress argument is to hold that each belief is justified in virtue of the next one being justified, but to claim that this is not a problem.** This is not what the sequence was meant to explain. All that we need is an explanation for each belief concerning why it is justified, and this we have.   Another example.

## What does one see in the way the commitment to reality is each of two incompatible ways? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : McTaggart’s regress looks vicious or benign depending on whether one is content to grant the legitimacy of the notion of temporal succession. There is never, at any stage, a contradiction, for we are never forced to say that a thing has incompatible properties. **If, by contrast, one sees in it simply an attempt to paper over what is ultimately a contradiction inherent in the commitment to reality being each of two incompatible ways, the way it supposedly is now and the way It supposedly was or will be.**

## The way it is now and the way it is are two ways that reality is different from reality? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : McTaggart’s regress looks vicious or benign depending on whether one is content to grant the legitimacy of the notion of temporal succession. There is never, at any stage, a contradiction, for we are never forced to say that a thing has incompatible properties. **If, by contrast, one sees in it simply an attempt to paper over what is ultimately a contradiction inherent in the commitment to reality being each of two incompatible ways, the way it supposedly is now and the way It supposedly was or will be.**

## What is the infinite thing that there is no impossibility in? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Ross Cameron applies considerations of theoretical parsimony to the case of infinite chains of ontological dependence. **While allowing that there is no impossibility in an infinite regress of things, each ontologically dependent on the next, Cameron argues that we can still have reason to reject such a theory on parsimony considerations.** For example, a physical theory that postulates one unified force to explain all phenomena would, other things being equal, be preferable to one that postsulates four fundamental forces. (Orilia argues, contra Cameron, thatthere is no unified explanation provided by Metaphysical Foundationalism over theories with infinite ontological descent.)

## What does each of the infinitely many \ s have? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Some philosophers have argued that when we have an infinite regress, with the \-ness of each \ being accounted for by appeal to another \ that is \, then we do indeed lack a global explanation of why there are things that are \. But we nevertheless have a local explanation for each of the infinitely many \s as to why it is \.   Distinguish between aLocal explanation of the    of some particular \ and a global explanations of any things at all.

## What does it take for the regress to do? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Bliss rejects the idea that in an infinitely descending chain of ontological dependence, being would never be achieved. Having a property dependent on some condition is nevertheless to have that property, so there is no pressure to conclude that nothing in the infinite series would exist. Rather, they all exist, and the existence of each is perfectly well accounted for: it exists because the next thing in the sequence does. **Why there is an infinite chain of existing entities at all is not accounted for, but Bliss says it is a mistake to think that the regress was ever supposed to account for that.**

## What does the same principles of a theory generate that lead to a contradiction? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **One such kind of case is when the very same principles of a theory that generate the regress also lead to a contradiction.** If this is so then it does not matter what we think about infinite regress in general, we will of course have reason to reject the theory, because it is contradictory. Two such examples are discussed by Daniel Nolan , and we will recount one of them here. The theory in question is Plato’s theory of Forms, and the regress objection is Parmenides's Third Man objection.

## What is an infinite sequence of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Klein: It is overwhelmingly plausible that \ can only serve as the ontological ground of \ because \ itself exists, or is the way it is. But it is not forced on us to hold that   can only be a reason for  because \ is itself justified, and this is why Klein’s response to the epistemic regress is available. It need be no part of the explanation for why \ is a reason  that \ itself be justified. **So while there is indeed an infinite sequence of propositions, each of which is a. reason for the previous one on the list, at no stage is the fact that one proposition is a reasons for another hostage to any other.**

## What is the regress? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : If we are seeking an explanation of how or why a thing exists, and so on ad infinitum, the regress is benign. In order to explain facts about my existence, we can make recourse to the existence of my parents, my vital organs, etc. At each stage of the regress, we have a satisfactory explanation of that for which we areseeking one. **The regress is harmless because where the explanans and explanandum are not of the same form, we don't need to regress.**

## Who concludes that we end up attributing each a - property to every time? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The A-series of time is the sequence of times one of which is present, others past, and others future. McTaggart concludes that we end up attributing each A-property to every time (and therefore to every event in time) This is absurd, because the A-properties are incompatible: to have one is to have neither of the others. Each time both has only one such property, and all such properties. The A- series cannot be real, says Mc taggart.

## Blbo's doing what is not part of reality? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **The way things were and the way things will be seems to be part of reality in a way that, for example, Bilbo’s finding the One Ring is not.** How can they both contribute to the way reality is if they are incompatible? The defender of the A-series replies that in giving the complete account of how reality is we have to take seriously the fact that reality changes and that it is, therefore, different ways successively, and there is no inconsistency in things being one way and then another.

## There is no pressure to do what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Bliss rejects the idea that in an infinitely descending chain of ontological dependence, being would never be achieved. **Having a property dependent on some condition is nevertheless to have that property, so there is no pressure to conclude that nothing in the infinite series would exist.** Rather, they all exist, and the existence of each is perfectly well accounted for: it exists because the next thing in the sequence does. Why there is an infinite chain of existing entities at all is not accounted for, but Bliss says it is a mistake to think that the regress was ever supposed to account for that.

## How is grounding asymmetric? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **If we were providing the metaphysical grounds of rates of change, Smart might be right that this would lead to a vicious regress, since arguably grounding is asymmetric.** But that is not what is going on. When we explain the speed of the car by appeal to the passage of time, we’re not providing the ontological grounds of its speed. Likewise for the rate of time’s passage itself: we are not seeking to provide the ontology of time in stating its rate. Rather, when we compare the two changes, we are simply trying to illuminate one or both of those changes by pointing to the way they relate.

## Every being derives its reality from the reality of what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Where there are only beings by aggregation [composite objects], there are no real beings. For every being by aggregation presupposes beings endowed with real unity [simples]. **Every being derives its reality only from the reality of those beings of which it is composed, so that it will not have any reality at all if it is not itself a being of aggregation.** We must still seek further grounds for its reality, grounds which can never be found in this way, if we must always continue to seek for them.

## What does the theory of infinite regress do to an infinite regress? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **This is an easy case, because we don’t have to adjudicate on whether the fact that the theory leads to an infinite regress is itself objectionable.** The principles that lead to regress also lead to contradiction, and we know that a theory’s being contradictory is a good reason to reject it, whether it leads to regress or not.   This is anEasy case, Because we don't have to. Theory leads to infinite regress, but it also leads to contradiction.

## What is an infinite regress taken to reveal? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **In section 1 we looked at cases where an infinite regress is taken to reveal some feature that might, possibly depending on your other theoretical commitments, be taken to be a reason to reject a theory.** But sometimes the regress itself is taken by some to be an objectionable feature of the theory that yields it. In this section we look at cases in which the regress is seen to reveal a feature of a theory independent of its leading to regress that is a reasons to reject it. We conclude by looking at a case in which a theory leads to a regress that leads to an objection to it.

## What type of entity ultimately comes from the fundamental thing at the bottom of the chain? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : If the chain is infinite, the being of any thing is, arguably, as mysterious as Anne’s new bag of sugar. The explanation of where it came from is always postponed, and its presence in the system as a whole unexplained. **And for any finite chain, no matter how long, we can say where theBeing of any dependent entity ultimately comes from: from the fundamental thing at the bottom of the chain.** So, at least, goes the regress objection.   As with sugar, likewise with being—or justification, or goodness, or whatever feature we aim to account for.

## Markosian's maneuver is possible because in giving the rate of one process of change by what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Markosian’s maneuver is possible because in giving the rate of one process of change by appeal to a second process, we are not saying what makes it the case that the first change occurs at the rate it does.** Not that an hour of time passes while the car moves a distance of 40 miles, for that is merely a re-description of the fact in question: a way of describing the rate. In the case of time itself, defenders of the view that time passes may plausibly claim that it is simply the nature of time.

## What does it seem that there are infinitely descending chains of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Bliss argues that it is not necessarily a mark against infinitely descending chains of ontological dependence that it leaves this global fact—why does anything have being in the first place?—unexplained. She says that this is not a reason to deny the existence of the world, but to ask why it has been created in the way that it has. Bliss says that the answer is that the world was created in a way that makes it impossible to know why it was created. She argues that the question is not whether it is possible, but why it happened.
