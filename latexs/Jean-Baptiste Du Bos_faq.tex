\begin{quote}
\emph{summarized\_paragraph} : Some writers believe that artworks can be
valuable as a source of knowledge. At times Du Bos indicates that there
is something to this, and that art is valuable as more than the source
of valuable sentiments. \textbf{In the end, however, his considered
opinion is that, ``We can acquire some knowledge by reading a poem, but
this is scarcely the motive for opening the book'' Du Bos was aware that
some writers, including himself, believed that art was valuable for its

\begin{quote}
\emph{summarized\_paragraph} : According to Du Bos, we judge artworks by
means of our sentiments. He rejects the rationalist school of criticism
associated with writers such as Roland Fr√©art de Chambray. Du Bos mocks
these writers as `geometrical critics'. \textbf{In a similar vein, Bosse
wrote that the `noble art of painting must be based for the most part on
correct and rule-governed reasoning, which is to say, geometrical and,
consequently, demonstrative'}

\begin{quote}
\emph{summarized\_paragraph} : Du Bos values what he calls
vraisemblance. \textbf{Painters, for example, must ``make a painting
consistent with what we know of the customs, habits, architecture, and
arms of the people that one intends to represent'' A work can, however,
be vra isemblable without being an imitation of the real world and
historical events.} Vra is not an end in itself as it was for some
earlier thinkers. The real goal of the arts is to arouse sentiments and
vraIsemblance is only a means of doing so.

able to arouse emotions. He believes that painting has an advantage over
poetry on the grounds that natural signs affect us more effectively. He

both, as in opera) has anadvantage over painting. \textbf{Du Bos: Poetry

\begin{quote}
\emph{summarized\_paragraph} : The concept of sentiments is crucial to
Du Bos's thought. He seems to have been the writer who made talk of
sentiments so commonplace in eighteenth-century aesthetics. Du Bos never
precisely defines what he means when he speaks of sentiments. \textbf{In
what is, perhaps, the closest he comes to a definition he writes that,
``The first ideas born in the soul, when it receives a lively
stimulus,\ldots we call sentiments'' According toDu Bos, sentiments are
not produced by a special sort of aesthetic experience.} They are, as
already indicated, ordinary emotional responses.

\begin{quote}
\emph{summarized\_paragraph} : Du Bos says that the faithful depiction
of the passions suffices to make us afraid and make us resolve to avoid
them. This later passage is apparently influenced by Aristotle's Poetics
since Du Bos speaks of the purging of emotions. For example, we watch a
performance of Medea and we are horrified by the passion for vengeance
and resolve not to indulge in it. \textbf{Later in the Critical
Reflections Du Bos returns to the paradox of tragedy and gives a rather
different solution.}
