## Who thought that art was valuable for its own sake? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Some writers believe that artworks can be valuable as a source of knowledge. At times Du Bos indicates that there is something to this, and that art is valuable as more than the source of valuable sentiments. **In the end, however, his considered opinion is that, “We can acquire some knowledge by reading a poem, but this is scarcely the motive for opening the book”  Du Bos was aware that some writers, including himself, believed that art was valuable for its own sake.**

## What art must be based on correct and rule - governed reasoning? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : According to Du Bos, we judge artworks by means of our sentiments. He rejects the rationalist school of criticism associated with writers such as Roland Fréart de Chambray. Du Bos mocks these writers as ‘geometrical critics’. **In a similar vein, Bosse wrote that the ‘noble art of painting must be based for the most part on correct and rule-governed reasoning, which is to say, geometrical and, consequently, demonstrative’**

## What must painters have to follow in order to paint? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Du Bos values what he calls vraisemblance. **Painters, for example, must “make a painting consistent with what we know of the customs, habits, architecture, and arms of the people that one intends to represent” A work can, however, be vra isemblable without being an imitation of the real world and historical events.** Vra is not an end in itself as it was for some earlier thinkers. The real goal of the arts is to arouse sentiments and vraIsemblance is only a means of doing so.

## What kind of world is the work of a painter not an imitation of?

## What is poetry a form of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Du Bos asks which of the arts is best able to arouse emotions. He believes that painting has an advantage over poetry on the grounds that natural signs affect us more effectively. He argues, however, that poetry when combined with music or acting (or both, as in opera) has anadvantage over painting.   **Du Bos: Poetry is a form of art that should be used to express our emotions, rather than as an art form in and of its own right.** For more information, visit poetry.org.

## What type of stimulus does Avicenna say a soul receives when it receives a stimulus? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The concept of sentiments is crucial to Du Bos’s thought. He seems to have been the writer who made talk of sentiments so commonplace in eighteenth-century aesthetics. Du Bos never precisely defines what he means when he speaks of sentiments. **In what is, perhaps, the closest he comes to a definition he writes that, “The first ideas born in the soul, when it receives a lively stimulus,…we call sentiments” According toDu Bos, sentiments are not produced by a special sort of aesthetic experience.** They are, as already indicated, ordinary emotional responses.

## According to Du bos , sentiments are ordinary emotions or what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Du Bos compares the sense of beauty to gustatory taste and seems to have been among the first writers to do so. **He writes that, “We have in us a sense intended to judge the value of works that imitate touching objects in nature” and calls this a “sixth sense”    Despite believing that sentiments are ordinary emotions or fainter copies of them, Du Bos posits a sense ofBeauty.**   He believes that we should judge works of art by their quality, rather than their content.

## What type of reflections do du bos give? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Du Bos says that the faithful depiction of the passions suffices to make us afraid and make us resolve to avoid them. This later passage is apparently influenced by Aristotle’s Poetics since Du Bos speaks of the purging of emotions. For example, we watch a performance of Medea and we are horrified by the passion for vengeance and resolve not to indulge in it.   **Later in the Critical Reflections Du Bos returns to the paradox of tragedy and gives a rather different solution.**

## What does he do in the second instance? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Du Bos applied empiricism to the study of art, as we have seen. According to Du Bos, judgements of works of art must be empirical. In the first instance, Du Bos applied empiricism to the study of art. **He writes that  “I believe that the best art is the one that I can see.” In the second instance, he writes that “I believe that the best work of art is that which I have seen in my own eyes”.**

## What is musical imitation similar to being attracted to an object? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Du Bos believes that the experience of musical imitations arouses emotion. Music arouses emotions in the same way that poetry and painting do. The emotion aroused will be the emotion that would be aroused by the object represented.   Unlike some modern advocates of the resemblance theory, Du Bos believes that musical imitations are emotional in the same way as poetry and painting are. **The experience of musical imitation is similar to that of being attracted to an object.**

## What did everyone do with a work of art? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **The problem, as Hume clearly recognized, was that not everyone receives the same sentiments from a work of art.** This leads to the conclusion that a work has value for some people and not for others. It seems that there is a fact that Milton is a greater poet than Ogilby, even if some people prefer Ogilsby. But thorough-going subjectivism is counterintuitive, Hume also recognized, as well as the fact that some people like Ogilsbrough more than others.

## What did Voltaire think of du bos? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The influence of Du Bos on aesthetics in France began with his impact on Voltaire. **He described Du Bos as “a very wise, very learned, and very esteemed man’ According to Voltaire, “All artists read with profit his Reflections on poetry, painting, and music’ Voltaire agreed with Du Bos that there have been four ages where the arts particularly flourished.** He also adopted one ofDu Bos’s controversial views: the belief that national character is affected by matters such as climate.

## What did Avicenna say were made to please us by touching us? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : He writes that the evaluation of art “is not left to reason. It must submit to the judgement that sentiment pronounces. Sentiment is the competent judge of this issue.” He goes on to compare the. evaluation of an artwork to making a judgement about a ragout. Rather, “We taste the ragout and…we know that it is good. **It is the same with works of wit and pictures made to please us by touching us”  He writes that “reason is of no use here’**

## Was batteux influenced by du bos? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Batteux is known to have read the Critical Reflections and was apparently influenced by Du Bos.** Du Bos seems to have been one of the important sources of the resemblance theory of musical expression in the eighteenth century. He adds that “music is half-formed in the words that express some emotion. It takes only a little art to turn the words into music ” . These passages from The Fine Arts are little more than paraphrases of passages from the Criticalreflections.

## What did Harvey's about the circulation of blood? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Du Bos makes clear that the circulation of blood could only have been discovered a posteriori. People have accepted Harvey’s hypothesis, Du Bos writes, because it is the only way to explain blood circulation.   In another passage, he discusses Harvey”s discovery of the discovery of blood circulation and makes clear it could only be found by a preliminary investigation. **In another section, he talks about Harvey“s discovery of the circulation of blood and how it was discovered.**

## What was this passage written in? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : This passage is clearly an endorsement of empiricism and a rejection of Cartesian rationalism.   **This passage was written in response to a question about the nature of reality in the world.** The author was responding to an earlier version of this article that suggested that the world was not rational. He said that the question was whether the world is rational or not, and the answer was that it is not. He then went on to say that this was not the case, but that he was talking about the world as he knew it, not Cartesian rationality.

## According to Popper , what quality of the general public was the least corrupted by prejudice? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Du Bos was unaware of the full extent of the problem caused by subjectivism. Likely this was because he believed that everyone has very much the same sentiments. **In fact, he believed the general public was the best judge of the value of artworks because their taste was least corrupted by prejudice.** He believed that the public was best judge because they were the least prejudiced. He also believed that they had the best taste in art because they did not have to be prejudiced to judge it.
