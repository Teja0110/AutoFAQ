Peter\\\\nSinger popularized the term and focused on the way speciesism, without\\\\nmoral justification, favors the interests of humans: '}, {'id': 2, 'text': '\\\\nthe racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight\\\\nto the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash\\\\nbetween their interests and the interests of those of another race.\\\\nSimilarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to\\\\noverride the greater interests of members of other species. The\\\\npattern is the same in each case. (Singer 1974: 108) '}, {'id': 3, 'text': '\\\\nDiscrimination based on race, like discrimination based on species is\\\\nthought to be prejudicial, because these are not characteristics that\\\\nmatter when it comes to making moral claims.'}, {'id': 4, 'text': '\\\\nSpeciesist actions and attitudes are prejudicial because there is no\\\\nprima facie reason for preferring the interests of beings\\\\nbelonging to the species group to which one also belongs over the\\\\ninterests of those who don’t.

Species membership is a\\\\nmorally irrelevant characteristic, a bit of luck that is no more\\\\nmorally interesting than being born in Malaysia or Canada. As a\\\\nmorally irrelevant characteristic it cannot serve as the basis for a\\\\nview that holds that our species deserves moral consideration that is\\\\nnot owed to members of other species.'}, {'id': 5, 'text': '\\\\nOne might respond that it is not membership in a biological category\\\\nthat matters morally, but rather the social meaning of those\\\\ncategories, meanings that structure not only the institutions we\\\\noperate within, but how we conceptualize ourselves and our world.\\\\nHumans have developed moral systems as well as a wide range of other\\\\nvaluable practices, and by creating these systems, we separate the\\\\nhuman from the rest of the animal kingdom. But the category\\\\n“human” itself is morally contested. Some argue, for\\\\nexample, that racism is not simply, or even primarily about\\\\ndiscrimination and prejudice, but rather a mechanism of dehumanizing\\\\nblackness so as to provide the conditions that makes humans white (see\\\\nFanon 1967; Kim 2015; Ko& Ko 2017). According\\\\nto this line of thought, speciesism isn’t focused on\\\\ndiscrimination or prejudice but is a central tool for creating human\\\\n(and white) supremacy or exceptionalism.'}]}, {'id': 3, 'heading_text': '1.2 Human Exceptionalism', 'paragraphs': [{'id': 1, 'text': '\\\\nLike speciesism, human exceptionalism can be understood in different\\\\nways. The most common way of understanding it is to suggest that there\\\\nare distinctly human capacities and it is on the basis of these\\\\ncapacities that humans have moral status and other animals do not. But\\\\nwhich capacities mark out all and only humans as the kinds of beings\\\\nthat can be wronged? A number of candidate capacities have been\\\\nproposed—developing family ties, solving social problems,\\\\nexpressing emotions, starting wars, having sex for pleasure, using\\\\nlanguage, or thinking abstractly, are just a few. As it turns out,\\\\nnone of these activities is uncontroversially unique to human. Both\\\\nscholarly and popular work on animal behavior suggests that many of\\\\nthe activities that are thought to be distinct to humans occurs in\\\\nnon-humans. For example, many species of non-humans develop long\\\\nlasting kinship ties—orangutan mothers stay with their young for\\\\neight to ten years and while they eventually part company, they\\\\ncontinue to maintain their relationships. Less solitary animals, such\\\\nas chimpanzees, baboons, wolves, and elephants maintain extended\\\\nfamily units built upon complex individual relationships, for long\\\\nperiods of time. Meerkats in the Kalahari desert are known to\\\\nsacrifice their own safety by staying with sick or injured family\\\\nmembers so that the fatally ill will not die alone. All animals living\\\\nin socially complex groups must solve various problems that inevitably\\\\narise in such groups. Canids and primates are particularly adept at\\\\nit, yet even chickens and horses are known to recognize large numbers\\\\nof individuals in their social hierarchies and to maneuver within\\\\nthem. One of the ways that non-human animals negotiate their social\\\\nenvironments is by being particularly attentive to the emotional\\\\nstates of others around them. When a conspecific is angry, it is a\\\\ngood idea to get out of his way. Animals that develop life-long bonds\\\\nare known to suffer from the death of their partners. Some are even\\\\nsaid to die of sorrow. Darwin reported this in The Descent of\\\\nMan: “So intense is the grief of female monkeys for the\\\\nloss of their young, that it invariably caused the death of certain\\\\nkinds” (1871: 40). Jane Goodall’s report of the death of\\\\nthe healthy 8 year old chimpanzee Flint just three weeks after the\\\\ndeath of his mother Flo also suggests that sorrow can have a\\\\ndevastating effect on non-human animals (see Goodall 2000:\\\\n140–141 in Bekoff 2000). Coyotes, elephants and killer whales\\\\nare also among the species for which profound effects of grief have\\\\nbeen reported (Bekoff 2000) and many dog owners can provide similar\\\\naccounts. While the lives of many, perhaps most, non-humans in the\\\\nwild are consumed with struggle for survival, aggression and battle,\\\\nthere are some non-humans whose lives are characterized by expressions\\\\nof joy, playfulness, and a great deal of sex (Woods 2010). Recent\\\\nstudies in cognitive ethology have suggested that some non-humans\\\\nengage in manipulative and deceptive activity, can construct\\\\n“cognitive maps” for navigation, and some non-humans\\\\nappear to understand symbolic representation and are able to use\\\\n language.[1]'}, {'id': 2, 'text': '\\\\nIt appears that most of the capacities that are thought to distinguish\\\\nhumans as morally considerable beings, have been observed, often in\\\\nless elaborate form, in the non-human world. Because human behavior\\\\nand cognition share deep roots with the behavior and cognition of\\\\nother animals, approaches that try to find sharp behavioral or\\\\ncognitive boundaries between humans and other animals remain\\\\ncontroversial. For this reason, attempts to establish human uniqueness\\\\nby identifying certain capacities, are not the most promising when it\\\\ncomes to thinking hard about the moral status of animals.'}]}, {'id': 4, 'heading_text': '1.3 Personhood', 'paragraphs': [{'id': 1, 'text': '\\\\nNonetheless, there is something important that is thought to\\\\ndistinguish humans from non-humans that is not reducible to the\\\\nobservation of behavior best explained by possessing a certain\\\\ncapacity and that is our “personhood”. The notion of\\\\npersonhood identifies a category of morally considerable beings that\\\\nis thought to be coextensive with humanity. Historically, Kant is the\\\\nmost noted defender of personhood as the quality that makes a being\\\\nvaluable and thus morally considerable (for a contemporary utilitarian\\\\ndiscussion of personhood, see Varner 2012).

And so I changed. My\\\\nperception of the moral landscape and where I and the other animals\\\\nwere situated in it shifted. (Hursthouse 2000: 165–166; see also\\\\nDiamond 2001 [especially chs. 11 and 13], and Clarke 1977)'}, {'id': 5, 'text': '\\\\nAlice Crary argues that shifting perceptions of our moral landscapes\\\\noccur because these landscapes, and more precisely the rich worlds of\\\\nthose who inhabit them, are not morally neutral. The characteristics\\\\nthat philosophers tend to look for in other animals to determine\\\\nwhether or not they are morally considerable, according to Crary, are\\\\nalready infused with moral importance, “human beings and other\\\\nanimals have empirically discoverable moral characteristics” (my\\\\nemphasis, 2016: 85) that are, as she puts it “inside\\\\nethics”. These values often sneak in under a supposedly neutral\\\\ngloss. By explicitly locating these characteristics inside ethics, the\\\\ntexture, quality, and purposes of our ethical reflection on moral\\\\nconsiderability changes. Arriving at an adequate empirical\\\\nunderstanding requires non-neutral methods, identifying historical and\\\\ncultural perspectives as shaping how we consider other animals\\\\nmorally. What ethical questions we think are important and how we\\\\nframe and answer them, will be different if we see our lives and the\\\\nlives of other animals as already imbued with moral values. '}, {'id': 6, 'text': '\\\\nOther feminist philosophers have taken issue with the supposedly\\\\nmorally neutral methods of argumentation used to establish the moral\\\\nstatus of animals. For many feminists the traditional methods of\\\\nrational argumentation fail to take into account the feelings of\\\\nsympathy or empathy that humans have towards non-humans, feelings they\\\\nbelieve are central to a full account of what we owe non-humans and\\\\nwhy (see Adams & Donovan 1995; Donovan & Adams 2007; Adams\\\\n& Gruen 2014).'}, {'id': 7, 'text': '\\\\nFeminist philosophers have also challenged the individualism that is\\\\ncentral in the arguments for the moral status of animals. Rather than\\\\nidentifying intrinsic or innate properties that non-humans share with\\\\nhumans, some feminists have argued instead that we ought to understand\\\\nmoral status in relational terms given that moral recognition is\\\\ninvariably a social practice. As Elizabeth Anderson has written: '}, {'id': 8, 'text': '\\\\nMoral considerability is not an intrinsic property of any creature,\\\\nnor is it supervenient on only its intrinsic properties, such as its\\\\ncapacities. It depends, deeply, on the kind of relations they can have\\\\nwith us. (Anderson 2004: 289).'}, {'id': 9, 'text': '\\\\nAnd these relationships needn’t be direct. The reach of human\\\\nactivity has expanded across the entire globe and humans are entangled\\\\nwith each other and other animals in myriad ways. We participate in\\\\nactivities and institutions that directly or indirectly harm others by\\\\ncreating negative experiences, depriving them of their well-being, or\\\\ndenying them opportunities to be who they are and pursue what they\\\\ncare about. Philosophers Elisa Aaltola and Lori Gruen have argued for\\\\nrefining our empathetic imagination in order to improve our\\\\nrelationships with each other and other animals.'}, {'id': 10, 'text': '\\\\nEven though it is challenging to understand what it is like to be\\\\nanother, and even though we are limited by our inevitable\\\\nanthropocentric perspectives, being in respectful ethical relation\\\\ninvolves attempting to understand and respond to another’s\\\\nneeds, interests, desires, vulnerabilities, hopes, and perspectives.\\\\nWhat Gruen calls, “entangled empathy” is a process that\\\\ninvolves both affect and cognition (Gruen 2015). Individuals who are\\\\nempathizing with others respond to the other’s condition and\\\\nreflectively imagine themselves in the distinct position of the other\\\\nwhile staying attentive to both similarities and differences between\\\\nherself and her situation and that of the fellow creature with whom\\\\nshe is empathizing. Entangled empathy involves paying critical\\\\nattention to the broader conditions that may negatively affect the\\\\nexperiences and flourishing of those with whom one is empathizing, and\\\\nthis requires those of us empathizing to attend to things we might not\\\\nhave otherwise. It therefore also enhances our own experiences,\\\\ndevelops our moral imagination, and helps us to become more sensitive\\\\nperceivers. '}]}]\""

His view is difficult to interpret, even though\\nthe texts dealing with this topic (Categories, Topics\\nI, and Metaphysics V) are characteristically direct\\nin style. Still, there is some consensus among scholars that Aristotle\\nproposes three ways of understanding categories: as realities,\\nconcepts, and linguistic terms. Much of the subsequent philosophical\\ndiscussion of categories concerns the correctness of this view. Some\\nfavor a position according to which categories are realities, which\\nare then said to be reflected in thought and language; some endorse a\\nview of them merely as concepts, which are also said to be reflected\\nin language; some maintain that categories are merely linguistic\\nterms, and reject any implication that they are real entities or\\nconcepts; and still others maintain an inclusive view that contends\\nthat categories are all three: words, concepts, and extra-mental\\nentities.'},\n",

However,\\nsome commentators claim that Aristotle uses the term rather for kinds\\nof predication and kinds of beings (for example in Topics\\n103b20–27, and Metaphysics 1017a22–27; see Frede\\n1987, 29–48). In Categories, Aristotle uses the term\\ntechnically to refer to substance, quantity,\\nquality, relation, place, time,\\nposition, state, action, and\\naffection (9a27, 11b37, 11b7), although he also speaks of\\nless general terms, such as ‘white,’ ‘half,’\\nand ‘last year,’ and trans-categorial terms such as\\n‘good’ and ‘unity.’ Aristotle's\\ncategories are not, strictly speaking, the predicates we use when we\\nspeak in ordinary language; rather, they are the most general kinds of\\npredicates, or predications. Thus ‘white’ and\\n‘here’ do not refer to categories, but\\n‘quality’ and ‘place’ do. The Aristotelian\\ncategories may be taken as the most general predicates which can be\\npredicated or, alternatively, they are the most general kinds of\\npredication into which the predicates we use in ordinary discourse may\\nbe classified. They provide answers to direct questions such as when,\\nwhere, how, what, and so on. Terms that extend to more than one\\ncategory (e.g., ‘good’), or do not apply to categories\\n(e.g., ‘and’) are treated separately.\"},\n",

For Aristotle,\\nthe individual is not, strictly speaking, predicable, although there\\nare places in which he speaks of the individual as\\npredicable. Examples of individuals are this horse and a\\ncertain point of grammar present in the knower (1b5). The first\\nis what Aristotle calls a primary substance, which he defines\\nin Categories as that which is neither predicable of, nor\\npresent in, a subject (2a11). The second is, like a primary substance,\\nnon-predicable, but it can be present in a subject. Both are\\nindividual and neither is predicable.'},\n",

       "   'text': \"\\n\\nThat Aristotle refers to categories with the Greek term which\\ncorresponds roughly to the term ‘predicate’ in English\\ndoes not mean that he understood categories to be merely linguistic\\nterms.  Indeed, ‘predicate’ itself is used in a variety of\\nways by philosophers. Some think of predicates as properties of some\\nkind, some as concepts, some as words, and so on. Therefore, to say\\nthat something is a predicate does not necessarily mean that it is a\\nlinguistic term.  In the case of Aristotle, there is ample evidence in\\nCategories itself which suggests that categories are not just\\nlinguistic terms that reflect the fundamental ways in which we speak\\nabout things, but also ways in which things are. The interpretative\\ntradition that favors a linguistic or logical understanding of the\\ncategories goes back at least to Porphyry (1887, 56), who tries to\\nreconcile what he takes to be Aristotle's linguistic/logical position\\nwith Plato's metaphysics (Ebbesen 1990). Consider for example how\\nAristotle introduces the categories: “Of things said without any\\ncombination, each signifies either a substance or quantity or\\nqualification or a relative or where or when or being-in-a-position or\\nhaving or doing or being-affected” (1b25). Clearly, he is\\ntalking about language when he says, “Of things said\\nwithout combination, each signifies….” for\\nthings that are said and that signify are linguistic terms\\n(Poetics 1456b38ff; our emphasis). The linguistic emphasis is\\nreinforced elsewhere, when he adds that “of things which are\\nsaid without any combination none is either true or\\nfalse…” (2a9).\"},\n",
       "  {'id': 5,\n",
       "   'text': '\\n\\nAt the same time, these statements do not imply that what is signified\\nnecessarily has to be linguistic. Indeed, earlier in\\nCategories, Aristotle unabashedly mixes the language of\\n“language” with the language of “being” when\\nhe notes: “Of things that are: some are said\\nof a subject but are not in any subject. For example, man is\\nsaid of a subject, the individual man, but is not in any\\nsubject” (1a20; our emphasis). This text begins with a reference\\nto things that are (ta onta), but goes on to speak about\\nthings that are said (ta legomena). The same occurs in other\\nplaces (2a11). In a text from Metaphysics (1017a23–25),\\nthe isomorphism between being and language is openly expressed.'},\n",
       "  {'id': 6,\n",
       "   'text': '\\n\\nAristotle is less explicit about the understanding of categories as\\nconcepts. In Categories generally he does not speak about how\\nthings are conceived; rather, he speaks about how things are\\ncalled or how they are. At the same time, from what\\nhe says elsewhere about signification and the way we think, it is not\\nunreasonable to surmise that he also thinks of categories as concepts\\nof some kind. For example, at the beginning of On\\nInterpretation, he claims that “spoken sounds are symbols\\nof affections [or concepts] in the soul, and written marks symbols of\\nspoken sounds. And just as written marks are not the same for all men,\\nneither are spoken sounds. But what these are in the first place\\nsounds of–affections of the soul–are the same for all; and\\nwhat these affections are likenesses of–actual things–are\\nalso the same” (16a 4–8).'},\n",

Indeed, Aristotle never actually\\nsays that categories are words, concepts, or realities; he only speaks\\nof them as categories, that is, predicates. But\\n‘predicate’ can be used to mean realities, concepts, or\\nlinguistic terms. Aristotle does speak of categories as if\\nthey were realities or linguistic terms, and one can further infer\\nthat he could have spoken of them as if they were\\nconcepts. But this does not definitely clarify what he thinks about\\nthem. Indeed, on the basis of what he says we cannot determine for\\nsure that he even raises the question of the ultimate ontological\\nstatus of categories.  The situation is further obscured because\\nAristotle never identifies the discipline where categories are\\nsupposed to be studied and he treats them in both logical\\n(Categories, Topics) and metaphysical\\n(Metaphysics) contexts.'},\n",

In Categories he appears to consider them in\\nisolation from their syntactical context, but in Topics\\n(103b20–27) and Metaphysics (1017a23–25) he seems\\nto tie them to predication and, thus, to consider them in relation to\\na syntactical context. This ambiguity gives rise to different\\ninterpretations, such as that of Frede, who considers them to be kinds\\nof predications (1987), and that of Ryle, who views them as\\nindependent from syntactical context (1971). In short, the picture is\\nfar from clear, and this serves to separate Aristotle from authors who\\nexplicitly and exclusively view categories as reflecting syntactical\\ncontexts.'},\n",

However,\\nthere are some who argue for purely linguistic or conceptual ways of\\nunderstanding categories. In modern philosophy, the emphasis shifts\\ntoward the language of thought, a prime example of which is Immanuel\\nKant (1724–1804; see Gracia 2000).'}]}"
