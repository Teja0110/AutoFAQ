Where Heisenberg looked to the formalism and developed his famous uncertainty principle or indeterminacy relation, Bohr chose to analyze concrete experimental arrangements. In a way Bohr merely regarded Heisenburg’s relation as an expression of his general notion that our understanding of atomic phenomena builds on complementary descriptions. At Como in 1927 he presented for the first time his ideas according to which certain different descriptions are said to be complementary.",4.0,1.0,"{'software': {'name': 'GrammarBot', 'version': '4.3.1', 'apiVersion': 1, 'premium': False, 'premiumHint': ""You might be missing errors only the Premium version can find.

1703,Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,stanford.library.sydney.edu.au/entries/qm-copenhagen/index.html,What interpretation do many physicists and philosophers see the reduction of the wave function as an important part of?,many physicists and philosophers see the reduction of the wave function as an important part of the copenhagen interpretation.,Many physicists and philosophers see the reduction of the wave function as an important part of the Copenhagen interpretation. Bohr believed that particular kinematical and dynamical properties are relational because their attribution to a quantum system makes sense only in relation to a particular experimental set-up. He believed that these numerical properties could have a specific value only during a measurement. But Bohr never talked about the collapse of theWave packet. Nor did it make sense for him to do so because this would mean that one must understand the wavefunction as referring to something physically real.,7.0,4.0,"{'software': {'name': 'GrammarBot', 'version': '4.3.1', 'apiVersion': 1, 'premium': False, 'premiumHint': ""You might be missing errors only the Premium version can find.
