## Who wrote the 1947 book " what is cantor's continuum problem? " 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : In his 1947 “What is Cantor's Continuum Problem?”, Gödel expounds the view that in the case of meaningful propositions of mathematics, there is always a fact of the matter to be decided in a yes or no fashion. If there exists a domain of mathematical objects or concepts, then any meaningful proposition concerning them must be either true or  false. The Continuum Hypothesis is Gödel's example of a meaningful question. The concept “how many” leads “unambiguously” to a definite meaning of the hypothesis.

## What type of universe is the universe? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Gödel was compelled to this view of L by the  Leibnizian[18]  idea that, rather than the universe being “small,” that is, one with the minimum number of sets, it is more natural to think of the set theoretic universe as being as large as possible. This  idea would be reflected in his interest in maximality principles, i.e. principles which are meant to capture the intuitive idea that the universe of set theory is maximal in the sense that nothing can be added.

## Who gave the lecture on the theory of relativism? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Gödel's earlier conception of rationalism refers to mathematical rigor and includes the concept of having a genuine proof. It is therefore a more radical one than that to which he would later subscribe. One can see it at work at the end of the Gibbs lecture, after a sequence of arguments in favor of realism are given. **It can also be seen at the beginning of the Gödel Lectures on the Theory of Relativism, in which he argues for the existence of a "priceless" proof.**

## What did bernays write that the result of Gödel's drew the attention of the hilbert school to two? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Gödel's result drew attention of the Hilbert school to two observations: first, that intuitionistic logic goes beyond finitism, and secondly, that finitist systems may not be the only acceptable ones from the foundational point of view.   **Bernays has written  that this result of Gödel's drew the attention of  the Hilbert school to two observations:  that intuitionistic logic goes beyond finitism and that it may not be the only acceptable system.**

## What can be used to interpret the former by means of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Heyting arithmetic is defined to be the same as classical arithmetic, except that the underlying predicate logic is given by intuitionistic axioms and rules of inference. We now consider Gödel 1933e, in which Gödel showed, in effect, that intuitionistic arithmetic is only apparently weaker than classical first-order arithmetic. **This is because the latter can be interpreted within the former by means of a simple translation, and thus to be convinced of the consistency of classical arithmetic it is enough to be convinced of Heyting arithmetic.**

## What is the only way to prove a theorem without a formalization of it? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The above proof  of the Second Incompleteness Theorem is deceptively simple as it avoids the formalization. **A rigorous proof would have to establish the proof of ‘if P ⊢ φ, then P ⋅ 0 ≠ 1’ in P.   The above proof is not the only way to prove the Theorem, but it is the best way to show that it can be proved without a formalization of the proof.** The proof is published in the book ‘Incompletes’, published by Oxford University Press.

## What is the difference between the concept of provability in a specified formal system and provability by any correct means? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Gödel's result marks the beginning of provability logic. **It makes exact the difference between the concept of “provability in a specified formal system’ and that of ‘provability by any correct means’   This result of Gödel's , which marks the Beginning of Provability logic, is known as the Gödel paradox.**   It is the result of the experiment of proving the existence of a certain type of truth in a formal system. It is also known as the Gödel conjecture.

## What is still an element of < n , ∈ >? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **We used the Mostowski Collapse to construct the transitive set N. We now return to the proof of the CH in L. As it turns out, the real number A is still an element of < N, ∈ > .** By basic properties of L, A must be < Lα , ℵ0 > for some α. Since N is countable, α is also countable too. Thus A is constructible on a countable level, which was to have been shown.

## What does it mean to better understand v? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Study of forcing leads to a better understanding of V, says Hugh Woodin. Study of models of a theory is useful to understand the theory itself, he says. **This is reminiscent of a remark of Hugh Wood in, that studying forcing leads to a better Understanding of V. The general principle being that studying the models is useful to obtain a better picture of V , says Woodin in his book, "V: The Theory of Forces and Forces in the World"**

## What kind of foundation do many mathematicians think the axioms of set theory provide? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **"I believed that it was so clear that axiomatization in terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of mathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very much concerned with it" "But in recent times I have seen to my surprise that so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory provide the ideal foundation for mathematics" "It seemed to me that the time had come to publish a critique.** … first, I have in the meantime been occupied with other problems"

## What does one confines oneself to? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Perhaps the reason why no progress is made in mathematics (and there are so many unsolved problems), is that one confines oneself to the ext[ensional]—thence also the feeling of disappointment in the case of many theories, e.g., propositional logic and formalisation altogether. [22]    [22]' Perhaps the reasonwhy no progress has been made in Mathematics is that one confines oneself to the ext [ensional] - thence also the feeling of disappointment in the case of propositional logic.

## What axioms assert to exist? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The continuum problem is solved by finding an enumeration of the reals which is indexed by the countable ordinals. **The intuition behind the proof is to build a “small” model, one in which the absolute minimum number of reals is allowed, while at the same time the model is large enough to be closed under all the operations the ZF axioms assert to exist.** The strategy had been recognized as a promising one already by  Hilbert and was used to solve the continuum problem.

## What was set theory's 1923 result? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The failure of categoricity was already taken note of by Skolem in 1923, because it follows from the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. Any first order theory in a countable language that has a model has acountable model.   **As for set theory, the failure of set theory was already take note of in 1923.** Theorem: A theory with a model is a theory with countable models. Theorems: Theorem 1: Any theory with model has model; Theorem 2: A model has countable neighbors.

## Hilbert and ackermann ask whether a given axiom system for what order is complete? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Hilbert and Ackermann ask whether a certain explicitly given axiom system for the first order predicate calculus “…is complete in the sense that from it all logical formulas that are correct for each domain of individuals can be derived…” The question is whether there is a system that is “complete” in the way that “all logical formulas” are derived from it.** The answer is yes, they say, but it is not clear if there is such a system.

## What does the word natural mean? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Gödel may have meant by “natural completion” here “the correct completion,” or he may have mean to say no more than that the Axiom of Constructibility determines the notion of set in a definite way.** In any case he used the term ‘natural’ differently in a conversation with Wang on constructibility in 1972. He may have used the word ‘ natural’ to refer to the ‘correct completion’ of a set.

## What should be decided once conceptual analysis has been carried out? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Gödel believed that once the appropriate methods have been developed, philosophical problems such as those in ethics can be decisively solved. **As for mathematical assertions, such as the Continuum Hypothesis in set theory, once conceptual analysis has been carried out in the right way, that is, once the basic concepts, like that of “set,” have been completely clarified, the Continuity Hypotheses should be able to be decided, he says.** He adds: “Formal rights comprise a real science.”

## What does a real number thought of as a set of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Every real is constructed already on a countable level of the L-hierarchy. **To show this Gödel argued as follows: Suppose A is a real number thought of as a set of natural numbers.** By a simple procedure A can be converted into a transitive model. This procedure, used by Gödel already in 1937, was explicitly isolated by Mostowski. The resulting model is referred to as the Mostowski Collapse.   The difficulty here, if not of the whole proof altogether, lies in showing that every real is constructible.
