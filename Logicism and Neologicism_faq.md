## What is short and easy? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Wright sketched a derivation of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from Hume’s Principle. The deductions would be carried out in standard second-order logic. Such a system is unfree with respect to its number-abstractive terms. **This point holds even if the second- order logic in question is a free logic in the official sense of not being committed to the theorem-scheme for any well-formed singular term t. The proof of this point is short and easy, and is like the one given in  §1.2.**

## Whose three primitives are ‘ 0 ’ , ‘ natural number ’ and ‘ successor'? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Frege's procedure is in the form of defining Peano’s three primitives ‘0’, ‘natural number’ and ‘successor’ It is not necessary to use any axioms of set existence except in introducing terms of the form ‘NxFx’ And in proving , so that the argument could be carried out by taking  as an axiom.**  … We can put [Frege’S procedure] in the  form of defining Peano‘s three primitives, and proving Peano's axioms.

## How is the same similar to the same? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Russell sought to preserve Frege’s approach to defining cardinal numbers as classes of similar-sized classes. Russell, however, sought to retain the idea that cardinal numbers can be divided into similar-size classes. **He wrote that the cardinal numbers are ‘similar’ to each other in the same way that they are “similar” to one another in terms of size.‘Similar’ is the same as ‘the same’ in the sense of being ‘in the same place’.**

## What were the intended recipients of the sentence? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The Grundgesetze were intended to supply some instruction in this regard. **And the footnote to “Umfang’s” ends with the sentence “I assume that it is known what the extension of a concept is.” For those who nevertheless needed some instruction, they were meant to supply it.** For more information, visit the website of the German Academy of Sciences and Humanities at: http://www.scholarshop.org/grundgesettingze.

## What is a term of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Wright expressed reservations over whether “x = x” counts as a sortal predicate eligible to be prefixed by “the number of x such that” Now Wright was inquiring after what “is wanted for the exorcism of anti-zero” . **His considered answer is that a term of the form **#xFx will denote a number only if the concept F is both sortal and not indefinitely  extensible. So Wright subsequently hoped to make actual what he had previously alleged to be impossible to imagine.

## What is the answer to the question of the form?

## What should one be in to count any finite collection of objects? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Boolos provided an ingenious model (which had been anticipated informally by Geach ) to allay the misgiving about the consistency of full second-order logic with HP. Note, however, that this consistency proof works only when FA is taken on its own. FA should be applicable not only to concrete objects, but also to abstract mathematical entities such as real numbers and sets. **Provided only that one has a criterion of identity for the objects in question, one should be in a position to count any finite collection of them.**

## What type of expression is required in a language that is rich enough to provide the two forms of expression in what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Frege: If we countenance these two different ways of ‘carving’ one and the same propositional content, then we shall require, in whatever language is rich enough to provide the two forms of expression in question, the following logical equivalence, indicated by the two-way deducibility sign ⊣⊢.**  If, with Frege, we countenant these two ways of 'carving' one and. the same content, we shall need, in. whatever language, to provide, in whichever language, an equivalence between the two. forms in question.

## What is not committed to the concept of numbers as an object? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The form on the right, within a language devoid of the operator #, is completely innocent of any commitment to numbers as objects. If such a language is extended, however, by adding # to its stock of logical expressions, then one is thereby able to express the form onThe left, which is number-committal.  The form on The Right, within the same language, is not number-Committal, but number-free.  **This is because the language is not committed to the concept of numbers as an object.**

## The word r - bars can be used to refer to any of what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The second ancillary notion we shall express here as “x is R-barred by F”, or “F R-bars x’, is defined thus: “X is F R- bars x” and it is defined as ‘x is F-bars X’. **This is the definition of the “R-bars” part of the word ‘R’ in the ‘F’ part of ‘X’ and it can be used to refer to any of a number of things.**

## What is another term for the universe? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : There is an obvious corollary to the idea that the universe is made up of atoms and molecules. This is the case in the universe of atoms, molecules, and atoms. In the world of atoms there are also molecules, or atoms, or molecules. The idea of the universe being made up by atoms is that there are atoms, and molecules, that make up the universe. In this case, there are molecules, which in turn make up atoms. **This leads to the concept of the Universe, or the universe, as we know it.**

## What does " n " mean? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Zalta defines an equinumerosity relation among properties with respect to ordinary objects. **With ≈ in hand, Zalta offers the notion of a  number :   "N" is the number of objects that can be considered concrete.** The number of concrete objects can be as large as "n" or as small as "n" is the number of objects that can be considered concrete by the equinumerity relations.

## The number of what can be shown to be at least one or more in the form of a function? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The recursion axioms are provable using the recursionAxioms. The recursion Axioms can be used to prove a number of different types of recursion. **The number of recursions can be shown to be at least one or more in the form of a function.** The result is a number which is provable by recursion and the recursions are recursion-based. The results can be proved by using the recursion axioms, which are properly proved using recursion and the reconcurrence axis.

## What kind of point can we make about the use of number - abstraction in mathematics? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Frege’s point here can be made watertight, and general, after providing a few words of explanation about notation for number-abstraction.  We shall show how Frege's point here could be made more general, and watertight. **We shall also show how this point could be used to make a more general point about the use of number- Abstraction in mathematics.** We will conclude with an explanation of how to use number-Abstraction to make our point more general.

## What is the first thing that one makes to justify the statement that n is the same as 2? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Numerosity can be used as a justifying ground for the subsequent statement that the number of Fs is identical to 2. Of course (returning to our example where n = 2), one can consider matters in the converse logical direction. **If one makes the numerosity assertion first, then one can regard that as a justification for the next statement that n is the same as 2.** If n is greater than 2, then n is equal to 2, and if n is less than 2 then it is not.

## What is similar to the same number of other classes in the same class? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The cardinal number of a class α is defined as the class of all classes similar to α. Two classes are similar when there is a one-one relation between them. The cardinal number is the number of classes that are similar to each other. **It is the same as the number that is similar to the same number of other classes in the same class.** For more information on the cardinal number, see: cardinal number of classes and the class number of classes in a class.

## What is the same as the previous one?

We have, therefore, (suppressed parentheses, and so on)  Hence we have, and this is the result we seek. We have the result. We now have. The result is.  The result. is the conclusion. The conclusion. **is that the result is the same as the previous one, and we have the same result.**

## What tells us that the numbers are? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : ** HP tells us that the numbers **#xFx and #xGx will be identical if and only if the predicate-extensions that they respectively number are in one-one correspondence (under some two-place relation R) Another way of expressing this latter condition is to say that F and G are equinumerous.  HP says that the two numbers are identical if they are in a correspondence under a two-places relation R. This is not always the case, however, and sometimes they are not identical at all.

## What is another term for class? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **With impredicative ‘class abstracts’, the existence of such a class could not be guaranteed as a matter of logic.** Russell had to postulate that such classes existed. This came to be regarded as detracting from their status as would-be logical objects, and revealing them instead as no more than mathematical posits. Their existence was once again  a synthetic a priori matter, rather than one of analytic necessity and certainty. They were once again considered to be mathematical posits rather than logical objects.
