## What is a state of the soul? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : An example of motion in the wider sense is an act of the will. It is a change of state of some entity (namely the mind or soul), but would not have been thought of as local motion by most medieval thinkers. Thought and will were generally regarded as immaterial processes.   An example  is an action of the mind, such as changing the state of a person's mind. This would be seen as a change in state of the person's soul or mind.

## What is another term for the mind?

## What do many of the criticisms tend to a relational account of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Perception was, throughout the Middle Ages, a contentious topic, and it was also a topic in which the answers to strictly causal questions could influence philosophical positions. The ‘traditional’ view, dating back to Roger Bacon in the mid-thirteenth century, was that physical objects were known because they caused a succession of likenesses, or species. This position was attacked by thinkers such as Henry of Ghent, Peter Olivi,  and Duns Scotus. **Many of these criticisms tend towards a relational account of perception, in which – although species still play a role – the role that they play is to be a means by which we know things.**

## What kind of doubts are there about motion and rest? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Buridan and Oresme are – in some sense – precursors of Galileo. Their causal ontology is still, in important respects, thoroughly medieval. **Despite persistent doubts, there is still something of a distinction between motion and rest, and motion can only be the result of agency.** Contrast this with Galileo’s or – still more – Newton's account. Here uniform motion and. rest are treated on an equal footing, and, consequently, there can be no. unequivocal distinction betweenmotion and rest.

## What do stoics believe there is no end to? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Aristotle believes that there are processes in nature which are completed and regulated by a final state, or end, towards which they tend. As Adams puts it, Aristotle has a much stronger position on final causality than the Stoics. **The Stoics believe that there is no such thing as the end of a process, just the beginning of a new process.** Adams says that Aristotle's view is wrong, and that the process of growing a tree, for example, is not the end, but the beginning.

## What did ockham's position not have much on his contemporaries? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Ockham denies species not on the basis of empirical evidence, but purely and simply on the based of his razor. If we deny species, then we can give an account of the phenomena which uses fewer entities, because species are entities. **Although this position of Ockham’s did not have much influence on his contemporaries or followers, it is a good example of how causal reasoning is affected by tacit ontological assumptions.** The fact that species were seen as entities, led to an account which tried to do away with species. On the other hand, action at a distance was, despite its implausibility, entirely unaffected by the critique.

## How much information is found in the book on the structure of science? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : There is an extensive literature of medieval commentaries on the Posterior Analytics. However, it cannot be taken to be automatically relevant to the practice of reasoning in the Middle Ages. The logical metatheory (that of the syllogism) is far too restrictive, and the conditions placed on scientific demonstrations are far too stringent, for it to be a plausible description of very many actual processes of reasoning, in theMiddle Ages or at any other time. **We find in it a great deal of material on the authors’ attitudes to necessity, the structure of science, the relation between various sciences.**

## What does he often do about final causes? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The medieval literature is far from unanimous on these questions. William of Ockham, for example, who wrote several commentaries on Aristotle’s Physics, hardly has a uniform position. **He is quite happy with explanations of natural phenomena by means of efficient causes in general, but he will also often speak of final causes.** What is unclear is whether the final causes he speaks of (with varying degrees of strength in different works) have any explanatory role to play that cannot be reduced to efficient causality.

## What must be the causes of the state of affairs? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : There was a generally accepted metatheory, namely that of Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics, according to which scientific demonstrations were syllogistic proofs. **In the latter, the syllogisms involved must have middle terms that are causes of the state of affairs which is to be demonstrated.** This gives a theory of scientific reasoning in which the structure of the arguments is intimately tied up with the structures of the causal chains that they demonstrate. The second question is that of a meetingatheory.

## The importance of the theory of evolution led to careful analysis of what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : There is a large body of medieval literature which deals with general change of state. **It is important because it led to a great deal of careful analysis of continuous change.** This body of analysis was one of the contributing currents which led to the invention of the calculus in the sixteenth century. So, we can look at this literature from two viewpoints: either from the tradition which it grew out of – that of interpretations on Aristotle’s Physics and the picture of change found there – or from the viewpoint of what it lead to.

## What kind of causes are we now call? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Aristotle used the term ‘cause’ in a somewhat wider sense than is current nowadays. **Efficient causes are what we would now simply call ‘causes’ Final causes, however, are problematic: a final cause is an end or a purpose, and, whereas it is clear that rational agents act for the sake of ends, it is not clear that much else does.** It seems clear to us that the causality of a rationally pursued goal can be reduced to efficient causality.

## Did Avicenna do what to those that were not convinced by? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Ockham was very innovative, and altered the landscape of medieval thought quite decisively. **He produced a large number of interesting arguments, but, on the basis of these arguments, he adopted positions which many of his contemporaries were not convinced by.** So, although his arguments forced a reexamination of many philosophical and theological doctrines, the thinkers influenced by him took up a broad spectrum of positions, depending on which of his doctrines they assented to and which of them they rejected. Walter Chatton, for example, denied Ockham’s position on intuitive cognition – namely, that when we know singulars we do so by a separate intellectual faculty distinct from sense perception.

## What case can be examined by looking at? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Ockham, like other fourteenth-century theologians, frequently gives instances where we can make reliable causal inferences. These arguments frequently rely on a theory of natural kinds. For example, Ockham writes that we can come to know causal propositions on the basis of experience. The answer to the first question is quite straightforward. It is possible to make a reliable causal inference from experience. **This can be done by looking at the case of Buridan.** For more information on Buridan, visit the Buridan website.
