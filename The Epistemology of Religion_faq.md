# [The Epistemology of Religion](https://www.plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/index.html) 

## According to evidentialism , what is at best probable for a god? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **According to evidentialism it follows that if the arguments for there being a God, including any arguments from religious experience, are at best probable ones, and if, as most hold, God’s existence is not self-evident then no one would be justified in having full belief that there is a God.** And the same holds for other religious beliefs. It would not be justified to believe even partially (i.e., with less than full confidence) if there is not a balance of evidence for belief.

## What is an example of an epistemological theory that conflicts with the holding of religious beliefs? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Clifford: If an epistemological theory such as evidentialism conflicts with the holding of religious beliefs then that is so much the worse for the theory.**   At the other extreme from Clifford is the position of fideism, namely, that if a theory conflicts with a religious belief then it is bad for that theory. Clifford: If a theory like evidentialist conflicts with religious beliefs, then it's bad for the epistemology theory. If it doesn't conflict with religious belief, it's good for it.

## What are beliefs part of the cause of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Reformed epistemology could be correct and yet far less significant than its proponents take it to be. That would occur if in fact rather few religious beliefs are grounded in the sorts of ordinary religious experiences most believers have. **For it may well be that the beliefs are part of the cause of the experience rather than the other way round.** For example, it could be that most religious experiences are not the result of religious beliefs, but are the product of them. It could also be the case that the religious experience is more important than the religious belief.

## What can be asked about faith in the absence of belief? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Although the topic is religious belief the same questions can be asked about faith in the absence of belief, where the standards might be laxer.** John Schellenberg has argued that it is not justified to believe in a personal God. Note, though, that epistemological disputes between Hindu and Buddhist philosophers over a thousand years ago are much the same as those here considered. Finally, and more controversially, this entry concentrates on Western epistemology of religion, which is not, however, the same.

## What is the cause of a belief? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : In what might be called "counter-reformed epistemology" it could be allowed that a belief can be warranted if grounded in a religious tradition. **Such a belief would have to be caused in the right sort of way by the right kind of tradition.** As in the previous cases we might note that such grounding should be partially accessible to the believer. Rather little work has been done on this extension of reformed epistemology, but the social dimension of warrant has been noted.

## What does the autonomy thesis say religious utterances are to be judged by? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Wittgensteinian fideism says that there are various different “language games” and that it is appropriate to ask questions about justification within a language game. In this way epistemology is relativised to language games, themselves related to forms of life, and the one used for assessing religious claims is less stringent than evidentialism. Here there seems to be both an autonomy thesis and an incommensurability thesis. **The autonomy thesis tells us that religious utterances are only to be judged as justified or otherwise by the standards implicit in the religious form of life.**

## What are themselves justifiably held with full belief unless defeated by an objection? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Theistic philosophers may, of course, grant evidentialism and even grant its hegemony, but defend theism by providing the case which evidentialists demand. **To show the justifiability of full belief that there is a God it is sufficient  to have a deductively valid argument from premisses which are themselves justifiably held with full belief unless defeated by an objection.** The details of the arguments are not within the scope of an article on epistemology. What is of interest is the kind of argument put forward.

## Is it easy or easy to see how disputes between two religions can be seen as being mediated by divine inspiration? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : One obvious complication concerning religious disagreements is the appeal to divine inspiration, as a source of private epistemic superiority. **It is hard to see, though, how this could apply to disputes between two religions that both rely on the role of divine inspiration.** Perhaps the only substitute for unargued dismissal is argued dismissal, as in the case of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformed Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The case for argued dismissal can be summed up as: “I am not a Christian, I am a Muslim.”

## What are language games related to? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Wittgensteinian fideism says that there are various different “language games” and that it is appropriate to ask questions about justification within a language game. **In this way epistemology is relativised to language games, themselves related to forms of life, and the one used for assessing religious claims is less stringent than evidentialism.** Here there seems to be both an autonomy thesis and an incommensurability thesis.

## What type of study is the topic of this article? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ :  Epistemology is confusing because there are several sorts of items to be evaluated. **Since the topic of this article is the epistemology of religion not general epistemological it will be assumed that what is being evaluated is something related to faith, namely individual religious beliefs.** The way of evaluating religious beliefs is as justified or unjustified as the beliefs themselves. The subject of the article is religion and its role in the study of religion. The author is a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles.

## What should be treated with the same level of respect? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Wittgensteinian fideism would have been qualified out of existence. All serious intellectual enquiry should also be treated as parts of the one “game”, with one set of rules. The Judeo-Christian-Islamic “language game” would be part of this larger, autonomous metaphysical “ language game’. That modified account would cohere with the historical fact of the metaphysical commitment of that religious tradition. **In that case, though, it would seem that, not just the Judeo/Christian/Islamic ‘game’, but all serious intellectual inquiry should be treated with the same level of respect.**

## What belief is between 90 % and 60 %? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ :  Newman claims that evidentialism falsely presupposes that there are fine gradations on a scale from full belief through partial belief to partial disbelief to full disbelief. In such cases the only available states are those of full belief and full disbelief or, perhaps, full belief, and lack of full believe. **Of course someone can believe that theism has a probability between 90% and 60%, say, but that could be interpreted as believing that relative to the evidence theism is between 90 and 60%.** That is a comment on the strength of the case for theism not the expression of a merely partial belief.

## What do several religious traditions consider to be grounded in? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Reformed epistemology might allow as warranted those religious beliefs grounded in the event of revelation or inspiration. Mavrodes has argued that any belief due to a genuine revelation is warranted. Zagzebski argues that this would have the unacceptable consequence that warrant, and hence knowledge, becomes totally inaccessible either to the person concerned or the community. **In both cases, the question of whether a belief is genuinely grounded in religious experience or is genuinely grounding in inspiration is one that several religious traditions have paid attention to.**

## What is the term for a modification of evidential ism? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Reformed epistemology might be thought of as a modification of evidentialism in which the permissible kinds of evidence are expanded. Notable in  this context is Alston’s work arguing that certain kinds of religious experience can be assimilated to perception.  **Reformed epistemology might be thought of as a  modification of  evidential ism in which permissible kinds of evidence are expressed in a way that encourages perceived experience.**

## What is evidence that someone has had a religious experience with a certain content? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Most contemporary epistemology of religion may be called post modern in the sense of being a reaction to the Enlightenment, in particular to the thesis of the hegemony of evidentialism. Evidence may also include the beliefs directly due to memory and introspection. No beliefs asserting the content of religious or mystical experiences count as evidence. **But that does not prevent the claim that someone has had a religious experience with a certain content from counting as evidence, even if not treated as “self-evident”**

## What does evidence for theism justify? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Many natural theologians have, however, abandoned the search for demonstrative arguments, appealing instead to ones which are probable. **While there are differences of approach, the common theme is that there is evidence for theism but evidence of a probable rather than a conclusive kind, justifying belief but not full belief.** Notable in this regard are Mitchell’s cumulative argument and Swinburne's Bayesian reliance on probability. In a popular exposition of his argument SwinBurne appeals instead to an inference to the best explanation.

## What has been stipulated not to be evidence? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Evidentialism implies that no full religious belief is justified unless there is conclusive evidence for it, or it is self-evident. **The content of religious experience has been stipulated not to count as evidence.** So the only available evidence for these beliefs would seem to be non-religious premises. The only way of deciding whether the religious beliefs are justified would be to examine various arguments with the non- religious beliefs as premises and the religious Beliefs as conclusions.
