# [Philosophy of Biomedicine](https://www.plato.stanford.edu/entries/biomedicine/index.html) 

## What does not duplicate in the entry on concepts of health and disease? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The preceding section on purpose in biomedicine leads directly to the related issue of how health and disease are conceptualized. **This is something that will only be dealt with very briefly here, in part to avoid duplicating the content in the entry on  Concepts of Health and Disease.** Debates over the meaning of health and Disease are central to philosophy of medicine. This entry will not attempt to summarize that complex literature, and rather focus on how conceptions ofhealth and disease relate to biomedics.

## What is a major source of data banking? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The US National Cancer Institute defines biomedicine as synonymous with “allopathic medicine, conventional medicine, mainstream medicine, orthodox medicine, and Western medicine” By contrast, A. E. Clarke, Mamo, Fishman, Shim, and Fosket takes an expansive view of the nature of biomediine. **They argue that it is an evolving entity, a cohesive and developing whole that consists of elements ranging from the assertion that good health is a personal moral obligation to the increasing reliance on “computerization and data banking”**

## What is the hard problem of consciousness like to make sense of the patient? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The human mind and consciousness attract a special sense of awe. **While the hard problem of consciousness is not all that different from the problems facing attempts to make sense of the patient as a whole.** Patients live; their bodies function every second of the day, via an astounding series of interconnected processes. It stretches the imagination to think that a vital spirit or such is giving unity to each life. It is another way to think we humans are simply skin bags of chemical reactions. We are not the same thing.

## Biochemical puzzles are not yet what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **The potential for success and record of prior successes is an argument for at least operating under the assumption that biomedical scholars ought to continue treating biomedical mysteries as biochemical puzzles for which the relevant pieces have not yet been identified or assembled.**  In other words, the potential for successful research is a strong argument for treating them as a biochemical puzzle, rather than as a mystery, as is the record of successful research in this area in the U.S. and elsewhere. In the past, this has led some to call them "biological mysteries"

## Whose values and motivations are often used in these critiques? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Both EBM and other branches of biomedicine are united by a valuing of precise measurement. While precise measurement is achievable in the biochemistry lab, the practical and philosophical challenges are thornier when doing measurement at the level of the whole person or the population. **A common theme shared by these critiques is a concern about the fickleness and contingency of measurement leaving much room for practitioners’ values and motivations to shape the results of the measurement process, for good or for ill.**

## What part of a system is malfunctioning? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Disease is reduced to the state of a system in which there are malfunctioning parts (pathologies in body parts) Biomedicine takes illness seriously, but the philosophical framework of biomedicines leaves no space for the notions of existential transformation as part of illness. See also the discussion of phenomenology in  Section 3.4 of this article. The article was originally published in the online edition of The New York Review of Books, volume 2, issue 1, issue 2.

## What type of phenomena does theorize the domain of disease is restricted to? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Broadbent: Biomedicine actively excludes consideration of entities and processes that don’t fit into its worldview. The strongest case for this chauvinism rests more on pragmatic grounds than on philosophical assumptions, he says. **Broadbent: The assumption is that “the domain of disease and its causes is restricted to solely biological, chemical, and physical phenomena” This is a powerful argument, though it cuts both ways, he writes.** Section 5 discusses critiques attempting to undercut the value of what biomedicina has indeed built while operating under that approach.

## What is the birth of the clinic written as? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Michel Foucault’s  work, and use of the concepts biopower and biopolitics, remain touchstones for much of the critical discourse surrounding biomedicine. His critique of modern medicine is part of a career critiquing other aspects of modernity, including the related topic of psychiatry. **His famous work The Birth of the Clinic is written as a history, though in the process it highlighted aspects of biomedics that other scholars went on to critique as well.**

## Are clinical trials highly susceptible to manipulations to the experimental setup? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : A naturalistic concept of disease does not prevent social processes from altering the standards and practices of how the boundaries of these natural categories are drawn in practice. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes have been targeted by drug companies to not only create new treatments but to redraw the boundaries between healthy vs. pathological. **These efforts are in part accomplished via the design of clinical trials, which have the dangerous distinction of having very high epistemic value in the biomedical community, while remaining highly susceptible to manipulations to the experimental setup.**

## What does a change in the body and capacities of an ill person's illness affect? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ :  philosophical analysis is needed to fully appreciate the existential transformation illness brings about. This transformation cannot be accounted for as merely physical or mental dysfunction. **Rather, there is a need for a view of personhood as embodied, situated, and enactive, in order to explain how local changes to the ill person’s body and capacities modify her existence globally.**  …we must enlist philosophical analysis in order for us to fully understand the existential transformations that illness can bring about.’’

## What is known for being dehumanizing? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ :  Narrative medicine offers a revision to the biomedical model alternative based around the centrality of the story or narrative in human life. This notion that narrative is central to human experience offers a variety of potential operationalizations in clinical biomedical practice. It places additional value on the patient consultation and asks for improved active listening skills among clinicians. **Such listening has many potential benefits, including the potential to understand the meaning of what human dignity means for a given patient, an important benefit given that biomedical settings are known for being “dehumanizing”**

## What is one of the fundamental features of a biomedical perspective? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Among the many features of a biomedical perspective, three stand out as fundamental regarding its approach to investigating disease.** They are:. The role of the human body in the study of disease, as well as its role in the discovery of new treatments and treatments, and the role of our knowledge of the body in these discoveries. The importance of our ability to learn from our bodies, and to learn how to use them to treat disease, is a key feature of the biomedical perspective. It is also a key part of our understanding of the nature of disease.

## What can processes and events be viewed in? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : A process ontology considers causal relationships between events and processes to be foundational, rather than things. It implies complex causal relationships which may be said to be multi-factorial and non-linear.  A process Ontology may be described as a "process-based ontology" or a process-centered ontology. It may also be called a process theory or a processes-based theory. **It is based on the idea that processes and events are one and the same, and that they can be viewed in different ways.**

## What is used to determine the existence of the senses? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : The use of instrumentation is real and exists, according to the metaphysical thesis that only what is ascertainable by means of the five senses and by extension, the use of instruments is real. The use of Instrumentation is Real and exists is real according to metaphysical thesis.  The metaphysical thesis is that only. what is  ascertainable by means of the five senses is real and existence.  By extension, by extension the use. of instrumentations is real by extension by extension.   **the metaphysical s thesis that only what is ascertained by the five senses and  by extension the use of instrumentation is real and exists.**

## In what part of the world did biomedicine form? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Insofar as biomedicine formed in the West, it is helpful to see it in contrast to the medical and philosophical traditions that preceded it.** The most influential Western tradition prior to biomededicine is the Hippocratic tradition. At the core of Hippocratic medicine were two views. First, it made a commitment to methodological naturalism. Second, it understood health as a matter of balance—and disease as amatter of imbalance—of the humors. in turn directly tied to a much larger cosmology of the elements (e.g., blood is linked to air, the springtime, a combination of heat and moisture, the heart)

## What may or may not qualify as a paradigm? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **Biomedicine may or may not qualify as one of Thomas Kuhn’s “paradigms’ Biomedicines may also qualify as a different way of conceiving of the way that research communities intellectually cohere.** It”s a question of how biomedicin serves as a means of organizing and guiding research. The terms “framework” and “approach” are used here to describe biomededicine, in an attempt to avoid narrowly overcommitting to any particular philosophical system.

## What does the biological chauvinism side of the coin of biological chauvinism do to the biomedical framework? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Some philosophers of biomedicine have attempted to make headway in this question. They ask what it means for biomedical sciences to be ‘chauvinist’ and whether this is proper. **Curiously, there are two sides to the coin of biological chauvinism: one that directly supports the biomedical framework and one that challenges it.** Both help shed light on the relationship between biology and medicine and help to define what makes patients and their bodies special. For more information, visit the Biomedical Chauvinism website.

## What is the use of phenomenology to do to describe human lived experience? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : “Biochauvinism” is the view that there is something philosophically unique about biological organisms. Wolfe finds that sort of view inside the influential phenomenological work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The view that life has some animating entity (along the lines of spirit) that animates matter into a living being is one form of biochauvinistism. **Another form is the use of phenomenology to assert that human lived experience partly operates within a space-time context that is different from that of a rock.**
