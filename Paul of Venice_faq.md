# [Paul of Venice](https://www.plato.stanford.edu/entries/paul-venice/index.html) 

## What does he do with the meaning of the term'res'? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Paul agrees with Gregory that what is signified by a simple expression is different from what is Signified by complex expression. **But disagrees with him about the meaning of the term ‘res’ In his view, only positive beings are things, and a complex expression is not a positive being as it is not an item in one of the ten categorial lines.** In other words, even though states of affairs are not really, but only formally, different from individual things, they cannot in any way be regarded as things in the world.

## What does paul deny that a thing is a thing? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : According to Paul, the term ‘something’, taken in the first or second sense enumerated by Gregory, is a transcendental term. **Paul denies  that states of affairs, both actual and possible, are constitutive parts of the world really distinct from the categorial items, and  that whatever is signifiable by a complex expression is a thing.** If the supporters of Gregory’s opinion were to claim that ‘ something’ is not a transcendent term, it would follow that 'something' would be either less general or more general.

## What do the things have in relation to the mind of god? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : In his commentary on the Categories, Paul explains that the direct and adequate objects of propositions, which make them true, are molecular things  existing outside the soul. Such entities are complexe significabilia, the significata of propositions. **The first type of truth is the measure of the conformity  which all the things have in relation to their corresponding ideas in the mind of God, from which they derive.** The second type is also a real property of extramental things, which measures their various degrees of disposition to be apprehended by our intellect.

## What is the subject in a given class of objects? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Paul builds up a mixed system, where the copula of the standard philosophical sentences he deals with can have a threefold value. It means a partial identity between the subject-thing and the predicate-thing in the case of identical predication; it means a necessary link between forms in the cases of the first type of formal predication. **And it means that the subject in virtue of itself is necessarily a member of a given class of objects, which the predication labels and refers to.**

## What did paul of venice develop? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Paul of Venice worked out a new version of the standard medieval realist theories of knowledge, critical of the most common solutions proper to his intellectual environment. Much more stress is put on the question of class-membership, and on the intellective cognition of individuals.  **It is just in order to do away with the peculiar problems of the realist paradigm that Paul of Venice developed a new theory of knowledge.** He called it 'theory of knowledge' and said it was a new way of looking at knowledge.

## Along with nardi , ruello , and what other person , who said paul was an averroist? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **According to Nardi, Ruello, and Kuksewicz, Paul was an Averroist, as he would have supported the thesis of the unicity and separate character of such an intellect for the whole human species.** But this is false. On the contrary, Paul’s point of view for this question is close to that of Thomas Aquinas, whose arguments he utilizes in his commentaries on the De anima and on the Metaphysics. In these two Aristotelian commentaries he clearly rejects all the main theses of later medieval A verroism.

## What does the fourth argument say that god cannot do? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Paul argues that since in God each generic principle  is different from any corresponding specific principle , therefore specific principles too are different from each other. He affirms that if the generic and specific principles were not distinct, then God could not create something according to the generic principle without creating it according to a correlated specific principle. **The fourth argument is that, since God knows that animal is the genus of man, He thinks of them by means of two different principles; otherwise He could not distinguish them.**

## How would a general theory of the proposition be more rigorous? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Paul of Venice deals with the problem of the meaning and truth of sentences in his Logica Magna and in his commentaries on the Metaphysics and on the Categories. Paul’s purpose is twofold. **He intends  to determine the ontological status and nature of the complexe significabile more precisely; and  to develop a general theory of the proposition which would be logically more rigorous and less compromised by a metaphysics of the possible than that supported by Gregory of Rimini.** For this reason Paul deals with. the question of the truth and falsity of a proposition before examining the. problem of its meaning.

## The remote principle , in addition to the immanent principle , is insufficient for causing the existence or disappearance of an individual? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Paul successfully reconciles the Scotistic approach with certain Thomistic theses. Paul claims that the principle of individuation is twofold, immanent and remote. The immanent principle is the one whose presence necessarily entails the existence of the individual it constitutes. **The remote principle, on the other hand, is just what the immanent Principle presupposes, but whose presence and absence alone are insufficient for causing the existence or disappearance of an individual.**  This means that the relationship between common natures and singulars is ultimately grounded on individuated. No actual universality and no instantiation is possible without individuations.

## What is the need for further and higher activity on the part of the soul? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : In Nicoletti’s view the phantasm is a representation of the thing which started the process of knowing. The intentio singularis vaga still contains a sort of logical description of the generic matter which the singular thing is made of. For example, when we apprehend Socrates as a man, we know human essence just as instantiated by a singular item, and not in itself, as a specific type. **In order to have the concept of man, there is need of a further and higher activity on the part of the soul.** This further activity is the proper action of the active intellect.

## To what do forms signified by the subject - term of a proposition and the predicate - term share at least one of their substrates? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **To speak of identical predication it is sufficient that the form signified by the subject-term of a  proposition and the formSignified by  the predicate-term share at least one of their substrates of existence.** This is the case for propositions like ‘Man is  animal’ and ‘The universal-man is something white’ (‘Homo in communi est album’). One speaks of formal predication in two cases:  ‘The universal-man is something white’ or ‘He is a man.’

## The essence of a thing is different from its being? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Paul: The essence and being of any creature are not really distinct from each other. **The essence of a thing is formally different from its real being and from its essential being.** Specific and generic essences can keep on being even though no individual instantiates them, but in this case they do not have any actual existence. From that point of view, Socrates being a man is in reality Socrates himself considered together with all the properties of which he is the bearer. The proposition identifies only one of these properties, that signified by the predicate-term.

## According to the italian master , what are ideas self - subsistent? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **In the commentary on the Metaphysics, the Italian master, after denying that the ideas are self-subsistent entities, as Plato thought, maintains that the meaning of the term ‘idea’ is twofold.** From these definitions, which he considers consonant with the teaching of Aristotle and Averroes, Paul derives four consequences or theses, which, taken together, represent the very core of his theory of divine ideas. Paul: An idea is a specific essence existing in God’s mind as a causal model for the production of something.

## What is indirectly connected to the intelligible species by means of? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : In the extramental world universal essences and individual things come together, since they are really identical and only formally distinct. In a certain way they are two different aspects of the same thing. This fact explains what happens in the process of knowledge according to Paul. **Since the intelligible species is directly connected with the essence of a thing and indirectly, by means of the phantasm, with the singular thing itself.** Our intellect grasps the universal essence and the individual thing at the same time, so that both are the primary objects of our mind.

## According to paul , what do the ten categories modulate according to? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : **According to Paul, being is univocally shared by everything real, since it is the stuff that the ten categories modulate according to their own essence.** In view of this position, Paul maintains no real distinction between essence and being. Like Duns Scotus and Wyclif, Paul speaks of a formal difference (or difference of reason) between essence  and being in creatures. The essence and the essential being of a thing are one and the same entity considered from two distinct points of view, intensionally and extensionally.

## The soul is known as what? 
> _summarized_paragraph_ : Paul of Venice tried to solve the aporetic aspects of Duns Scotus’ theory of individuation. Scotus said nothing about the problem of the relation between the thisness and the particular matter and form that constitute the individual. The Franciscan master was also silent about a possible identification of the thiss with one of the two essential forms of the individual substance, the forma partis (for instance, the individual soul) and the form a totius. Paul identifies the principle ofindividuation with the informing act through which the specific nature molds its matter. This identification had been already suggested in the Summa philosophiae naturalis.
